Car Rental Management System – README
A. Project Overview
Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to implement a backend Car Rental Management System using Java, Object-Oriented Programming principles, and PostgreSQL with JDBC.

The system manages cars, customers, and rentals and demonstrates full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a clean multi-layer architecture.

This is a console-based application that simulates backend API behavior using service and repository layers
